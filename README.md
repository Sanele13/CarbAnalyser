# CarbAnalyser
A tool to analyse a carbohydrate molecule. This will assist in optimising the geometry of the molecule, in order to minimise the energy of the molecule.

Input: a PDB file, containing the 3D structure of the molecule
Output: dihedral angles, angles, list of bonds, list of all angles, and number of atoms.
